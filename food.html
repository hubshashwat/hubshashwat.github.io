  <h1>What did I eat?</h1>
  <p>Here are some of my recent food experiences:</p>

  <p><strong>Chole Bhature at Anand Sweets</strong> [October 19, 2024]:
  I tried chole bhature from Anand Sweets and rated it <strong>4.5/5</strong>. The chole wasn't too spicy, and also had paneer. It was served with salad and pickles, making for a satisfying meal!</p>
